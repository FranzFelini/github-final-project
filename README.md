## Overview
This project is a simple calculator that computes the simple interest based on the principal amount, annual rate of interest, and the time period in years. It serves as an example script for demonstrating basic calculations and hosting projects on GitHub.

## Features
- Calculates simple interest using a shell script.
- Takes user input for:
  - Principal amount (`p`)
  - Time period in years (`t`)
  - Annual rate of interest (`r`)
- Outputs the calculated simple interest.
